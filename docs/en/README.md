DichromaticMap includes a numerical Python library and an interactive viewer for
SC/FCC/BCC tilt grain-boundary dichromatic patterns. It displays two grains by
axial layer and supports exact coincidence sites, local near-pair matching,
vector measurements, atom counting, uniform-strain common cells, PNG export and restorable sessions with numerical tables.

## Online guided tutorial

In the [online app](https://yazhuoliu.com/DichromaticMap/use.html), click
**Tutorial** beside the logo in the control panel after the pattern loads.
The guide starts only when you click it. A blue outline highlights each feature;
the bubble explains its purpose, suggests an action to try, and lists available
shortcuts. You can operate the controls and plot while the guide is open.

Use **Back** and **Next** to navigate, or the arrow keys while focused inside the
bubble. Switch between **English** and **中文** using the language selector.
Click **×**, press **Esc**, or finish the last step to close it. The guide opens
the relevant sections and tabs but does not change scientific parameters itself;
changes you make while trying the features remain. App shortcuts such as **R**
(boundary), **V** (vector), **M** (manual cell), **C** (center), **1 / 2** (boundary
sides), and **F** (all sides) work when focus is outside input fields.

## Installation and launch

For a viewer without installing Python, download the archive for your OS and
architecture from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Yazhuo-Liu/DichromaticMap/releases).
Extract the entire archive, then open `DichromaticMap.exe` (Windows),
`DichromaticMap.app` (macOS), or `DichromaticMap` (Linux). Keep its supporting
files together. These portable builds include Python and the GUI dependencies;
see [v0.2.2 downloads](../releases/v0.2.2.md#downloads) for platform and signing details.

**macOS first launch:** The portable `.app` is not signed or notarized, so
macOS may block it. If you downloaded it from this project's GitHub Releases
and trust it, try opening `DichromaticMap.app` once. Then go to **System
Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll to **Security**, click **Open Anyway**,
and confirm **Open**. Do not override a warning that the app is damaged or will
harm your Mac; report that issue instead. See [Apple's instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445).

The Python package requires Python 3.10 or later. Download the project and run the following from
its root directory to install the library and viewer:

```bash
python -m pip install ".[gui]"
python -m dichromatic_map
```

The numerical library requires NumPy; the viewer additionally uses PySide6 and
PyQtGraph. For numerical use only, install with `python -m pip install .`.
`dichromatic-map` is an equivalent viewer command. From the project root,
`python main.py` also launches the viewer.

```bash
python -m dichromatic_map --lattice SC --axis 100
python -m dichromatic_map --lattice BCC --axis 100
python -m dichromatic_map --axis "1 -1 3" --workers 4
python -m dichromatic_map --help
```

All plot coordinates, view dimensions and matching distances use a₀, the
reference lattice constant. A coordinate of 1 means one lattice constant.
The lattice-constant setting supplies its value in Å without changing the
normalized plot coordinates.

The three supported cubic Bravais lattices are simple cubic (`SC`), face-centered
cubic (`FCC`, the default) and body-centered cubic (`BCC`). Preset ⟨100⟩, ⟨110⟩,
⟨111⟩, ⟨112⟩ axes and custom integer axes are supported. Each geometry has its
own axial layers and repeat distance. These are point lattices with one atom
per primitive cell; additional multi-atom bases, such as diamond, are not supported.

For SC along a reduced integer axis [h k l], one axial repeat contains h²+k²+l²
layers. The repeat length is a₀√(h²+k²+l²), and the layer spacing is
a₀/√(h²+k²+l²). Thus SC [100], [110], [111] and [112] have 1, 2, 3 and 6 layers,
respectively. SC [100] shows only layer A. Matching, cell counting and strain
operations use the same layer rules for all three lattices.

### Command-line options

| Option | Meaning and default |
| --- | --- |
| `--lattice` | `FCC` (default), `BCC` or `SC` |
| `--axis` | Integer axis, default `110`; quote separated signed/multi-digit indices, e.g. `"1 -1 3"` |
| `--angle` | Reference misorientation in the selected axis range: ⟨100⟩ 0–45°, ⟨110⟩ 0–90°, ⟨111⟩ 0–60°, other cubic axes 0–180°; default Σ9 for `110`, Σ5 for `100`, lowest-Σ preset for other axes, or 0° if none exists |
| `--lattice-constant` | Reference a₀ in Å, default 3.52 |
| `--width`, `--height` | Base view dimensions in a₀, default 12 and 9 |
| `--marker-size` | Atom marker size parameter, default 32 |
| `--view-scale` | Initial field-size multiplier, 0.1–5, default 1 |
| `--workers` | Calculation processes, default up to 4, limited by available CPUs; use 1 for a single process |
| `--save` | Export the initial plot to PNG and exit |

### PNG export

```bash
python -m dichromatic_map --angle 22 --save pattern.png
```

For PNG export without a display server, set `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`. In a
shell that supports inline environment variables:

```bash
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen python -m dichromatic_map --workers 1 --save pattern.png
```

The viewer's `Export PNG…` button saves the current plot, including
display rotation and annotations. Check `Clean PNG (atoms only)` above the
button for an image containing only the visible atom symbols; see
[Saving the current plot](#gui-export).

<a id="gui-overview"></a>

## GUI overview

![DichromaticMap viewer](../images/gui-overview.png)

FCC ⟨110⟩ at the Σ9 preset, with the plot on the left and controls on the right.

The scrollable `Controls` panel is on the right. Switch the tabs at the top to
move between `ORIENTATION` and `LAYERS`. Click a section heading to expand or
collapse it. `GB / VECTOR` starts open; `VIEW / PERFORMANCE`, `NEAR-CSL` and
`MANUAL COMMON CELL` start collapsed. Scroll down to reach the status card
and export button.

| Area | Use it to |
| --- | --- |
| `ORIENTATION` | Choose FCC/BCC/SC, a viewing axis, a CSL preset or a custom angle; rotate the display |
| `LAYERS` | Show individual G1/G2 axial layers and the automatic common cell |
| `GB / VECTOR` | Pick a GB reference line, clip either grain to its sides, or measure a vector |
| `VIEW / PERFORMANCE` | Use `VIEW` for navigation and reference axes, `PERFORMANCE` for `CPU workers`, and `APPEARANCE` for grain colors, layer symbols and sizes |
| `NEAR-CSL` | Enable local near-pair matching or search for a strained periodic cell |
| `MANUAL COMMON CELL` | Select four common sites, count atoms, and optionally apply selected-cell strain |
| Status card | Read the next picking instruction, visible atom/CSL counts, and calculation status |

The status card counts points in the current view. The manual-cell panel counts
the complete selected polygons, so the two totals answer different questions.

| Plot marker | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Filled atoms / outlined atoms | Grain 1 (G1) / Grain 2 (G2); blue / orange-red by default |
| Circle, diamond, triangle and other shapes | Axial layers; match the shape and layer name to the legend or `LAYERS` checkboxes |
| Gold markers | Same-layer exact CSL sites |
| Purple midpoint markers and short dotted links | Local near pairs and their actual atom endpoints |
| Teal dashed outline | Automatic common periodic cell, when enabled and available |
| Arrows in each grain's selected color at the lower left | Perpendicular in-plane grain reference directions, labeled `[uvw]` |
| B1–B2 and a dark line | Picked GB reference and its left/right sides |
| P1–P2 and a purple arrow | Measured vector |
| C1–C4 and outlines in the selected grain colors | Manual-cell vertices and the separate G1/G2 polygons |

The legend follows enabled layers and overlays. It shows at most six enabled
layers; use `LAYERS` to inspect others. Every layer has a distinct symbol. The
first twelve layers retain the original default shapes; additional layers use
numbered circles. Customize them in `VIEW / PERFORMANCE → APPEARANCE`.

### Example analysis plot

<a href="../images/dichromatic_pattern_example.png"><img src="../images/dichromatic_pattern_example.png" alt="FCC ⟨110⟩ dichromatic pattern at 22 degrees, showing axial layers, coincidence sites, a selected cell, atom counts, and a cross-grain vector" width="900"></a>

FCC ⟨110⟩ at a 22° reference misorientation. The plot shows both grains'
axial layers, coincidence markers, a selected four-vertex cell with separate
G1/G2 atom counts, and a cross-grain vector after selected-cell bulk strain.
[Open the full-resolution image](../images/dichromatic_pattern_example.png).

<a id="gui-quick-start"></a>

### First session: inspect, measure and export

1. Launch `python -m dichromatic_map`. The default is FCC ⟨110⟩ at the Σ9
   preset. Wait for the status card to finish updating the atoms and CSL sites.
2. Open `LAYERS`, click `No layers`, then enable the A layer for both G1 and
   G2. This isolates one layer and its gold CSL markers.
3. Check `Automatic common cell`, then click `Fit cell` to frame the available
   periodic cell. Use the wheel to zoom further or drag to pan.
4. Click `Measure vector` (`V`), then click two distinct visible atom positions.
   Check the P1/P2 labels and vector annotation. Press `V` for a new measurement.
5. Expand `MANUAL COMMON CELL`, click `Pick 4 CSL vertices` (`M`) and select
   four gold sites in clockwise or counterclockwise order around a convex
   quadrilateral. Read G1/G2 counts in the panel and at the lower right of the
   plot. Use `Fit` to frame your selection.
6. Scroll to `Export PNG…`, choose a destination and save the image.

<a id="gui-orientation"></a>

## Setting the crystal and orientation

In `ORIENTATION`, use `CRYSTAL / AXIS` to choose `Structure` (`FCC`, `BCC` or `SC`)
and `View axis` (⟨100⟩, ⟨110⟩, ⟨111⟩ or ⟨112⟩). For another axis,
choose `Custom [h k l]`, enter three integers such as `1 -1 3`, then click
`Apply axis` or press Enter. An invalid axis displays a message below the field;
the existing geometry remains in use. Separate signed or multi-digit indices
with spaces; the all-zero axis is invalid.

Choose a `CSL preset` for an exact preset angle, or change `Misorientation`
with the number field or slider. Their range and the nearby range hint follow
the selected axis; the preset menu includes only angles within that range:

| Cubic tilt-axis family | Misorientation range | Rotation period about the axis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ⟨100⟩ | 0–45° | 90° |
| ⟨110⟩ | 0–90° | 180° |
| ⟨111⟩ | 0–60° | 120° |
| Other axes, including ⟨112⟩ | 0–180° | 360° |

These ranges apply to SC, FCC and BCC. Custom `[h k l]` indices are reduced
and evaluated using cubic symmetry, including sign changes and permutations;
for example, `0 -2 2` uses the ⟨110⟩ range. The upper bound is half the rotation
period because exchanging the two grains identifies opposite relative rotations.
This reduction keeps the selected tilt axis fixed; it does not minimize the angle
over all cubic axis representations. If a crystal symmetry cannot be determined,
the general range is 0–180°.

The command-line `--angle` option uses the same bounds and rejects out-of-range
values instead of changing them to a symmetry-equivalent angle. The number field
shows two decimal places; the `Exact θ` readout below shows the stored angle with
more precision.
Use the preset entry to retain its exact angle. Selecting `Custom angle` alone
does not change the angle; enter the desired value. After moving the slider,
wait for CSL markers and enabled Near-CSL results before picking sites.

Changing the crystal, axis or misorientation clears GB, vector and manual-cell
selections and any applied strain. Changing the axis also selects its default
angle; changing the crystal or axis restores all layer checkboxes.

`Display rotation` ranges from −180° to +180°; use its field or slider and click
`0°` to reset it. Both grains and their overlays rotate while the screen grid
remains fixed. The reference misorientation, physical strain and grain-frame
vector components stay the same. Existing selections remain available, and
PNG export includes this rotation.

<a id="gui-layers"></a>

## Choosing visible layers and the automatic cell

Open `LAYERS`. The information above the checkboxes gives the number of axial
layers, their spacing and the axial repeat. Hover over a grain/layer checkbox
to see its height in a₀.

- `All layers` enables every layer in both grains; `No layers` clears them all.
- Each `G1` and `G2` layer checkbox acts independently. To isolate one layer,
  click `No layers`, then enable that layer in both grain columns.
- Gold CSL and purple near-pair markers require that layer in both grains.
  Hiding one grain's layer also hides its matching overlay.
- Hidden atoms cannot be picked. A selected manual cell keeps its counted
  layer regardless of later display-layer changes.

`Automatic common cell` is off initially. Enable it to show the available
exact or strained periodic cell, then use the adjacent `Fit cell` to bring
that cell into view. The checkbox controls the outline; it does not run a
Near-CSL search. If no common cell is available, no outline appears and
`Fit cell` is unavailable. This cell is distinct from a manually picked region.

<a id="gui-view"></a>

## Navigating the plot

Drag with the left mouse button to pan; use the wheel to zoom. A drag moves
the view even during picking, while a left click selects a point. Pan, zoom
and clicks on empty space preserve unfinished selections. Read the status
card if a click is rejected.

Expand `VIEW / PERFORMANCE` and open `VIEW`. `Field size` sets the visible span
relative to the launch dimensions (12 × 9 a₀ by default). Larger multipliers
show more atoms; smaller ones magnify a smaller region. Use the slider or
`0.1×`, `0.5×`, `1×`, `2×`, `3×`, `5×` buttons. `Center view` (`C`) centers the
current field on the origin while keeping its scale. Use `Fit cell` in `LAYERS`
for an automatic cell or `Fit` in `MANUAL COMMON CELL` for a selected polygon.

`Grain reference axes` is checked by default in `VIEW`. It shows two perpendicular
in-plane reference directions for each grain in its selected color (blue for G1
and orange for G2 by default), with crystal direction labels `[uvw]`. For a [110]
viewing axis, the labels are
`[-1 1 0]` and `[0 0 1]`. All four arrows share one fixed origin at the lower left
of the viewport. Color distinguishes the grains, without G1/G2 headings.
The origin and panel size stay fixed as the arrows rotate, and panning or zooming
preserves their screen size and placement. They indicate orientation, not atom
positions or vector lengths. Uncheck the option to hide them and free that area.

The arrows follow each grain's reference rotation (± half the misorientation)
and `Display rotation`. With strain applied, they also follow the grain's polar
rigid rotation and remain perpendicular. They are an orthogonal reference frame,
not the actual sheared or stretched lattice vectors. Vector measurements report
actual displacements; their readout is placed above the axes while the overlay
is visible. Normal PNG export includes the axes when enabled; clean export omits them.

In `PERFORMANCE`, `CPU workers` controls calculation processes. Changing it
refreshes calculations. More workers can help larger views and searches but
use more CPU resources; choose 1 if process creation is restricted. Navigation
remains available during calculation. After a geometry change, wait for new
atom positions before picking.

<a id="gui-appearance"></a>

## Choosing grain colors, layer symbols and sizes

Expand `VIEW / PERFORMANCE` and open its third tab, `APPEARANCE`.

1. Click the G1 or G2 color button to open the color dialog. Choose a color and
   confirm; cancelling keeps the previous color. Each grain's atoms, reference
   arrows, manual-cell outlines, layer icons and legend update together.
   G1 retains filled markers and G2 retains outlined markers.
2. Use the symbol menu beside a layer to choose its marker. The selected symbol
   applies to that layer in both grains, including its CSL and local-pair markers.
   Other layers must use different symbols: choices already assigned elsewhere
   are disabled. Change the other layer first to free a symbol for reuse.
3. Set each layer's `Size` to a percentage from **25% to 400%**. The default,
   **100%**, preserves the original appearance; 50% halves the marker diameter
   and 200% doubles it. The setting applies to that layer in both grains and
   its CSL and local-pair markers. G1/G2 styling and the usual response to zoom
   are preserved. Each layer's size is independent of the other layers.
4. Click `Reset appearance` to restore the blue/orange grain colors, the
   original sequence of twelve shapes, and every size to 100%. Additional layers receive numbered
   circles, keeping all layer symbols distinct. Numbered circles are also
   available as explicit choices.

Appearance changes update the drawing without restarting calculations or clearing
picked points, counts, strain or translations. PNG export uses the selected styles.
Changing the lattice or view axis keeps the grain colors, symbol assignments
and sizes for retained layer indices; new layers receive unused default symbols
and a size of 100%. `Save session…`
saves these choices, and `Import session…` restores them. Older session files open
with a size of 100% if they have no saved sizes; files without saved colors and
symbols also use the defaults for those settings.

<a id="gui-boundary"></a>

## Defining a grain-boundary reference

1. In `GB / VECTOR`, click `Pick GB` (`R`). Click a visible atom for B1, then
   another at a distinct projected position for B2. Either grain is eligible.
2. The dark reference line appears, and the GB-side controls become visible.
   Left and right are relative to the directed line B1→B2, not screen left/right.
3. Use `G1 · Left`, `G1 · Right`, `G2 · Left`, `G2 · Right` independently, or
   choose `G1:L / G2:R` (`1`) or `G1:R / G2:L` (`2`) for opposite half-patterns.
4. Use `Show all sides` (`F`) to restore both sides. Layer checkboxes still
   apply. To replace the reference, press `R` and select two new atoms.

The line controls display-side clipping; it does not alter atom positions.
To remove it, press `R` to clear the old line, then `Esc` to leave picking mode.
Manual-cell counts use both sides unless `Apply GB side visibility to counts`
is checked in that panel.

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Action | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Drag / mouse wheel | Pan / zoom while retaining an unfinished selection |
| `R` | Clear the old GB reference and start picking B1/B2 |
| `V` | Clear the old vector and start picking P1/P2 |
| `M` | Start/resume manual picking, or pause it when active; starts a new cell if four vertices were complete |
| `C` | Center the view at its current scale |
| `F` | Show both GB sides of both grains; layer visibility still applies |
| `1` / `2` | Show G1 left/G2 right, or G1 right/G2 left |
| `Esc` | Return to idle mode while retaining selected points |

<a id="gui-vector"></a>

## Measuring vectors

In `GB / VECTOR`, click `Measure vector` (`V`), then click a visible atom for
P1 and a second atom at a distinct projected position for P2. Labels identify
the chosen grain and layer. You can pan or zoom between picks. The arrow and
a readout at the lower left of the plot appear after P2; the readout sits above
the grain reference axes when they are visible. The arrow represents P1→P2. A same-grain selection reports that grain's coordinates; a cross-grain selection reports both G1 and
G2 representations of the same physical displacement.

If atoms overlap, use `LAYERS` to hide the unwanted grain or layer before each
pick. At an exact G1/G2 picking tie, G1 is selected first; check the P1/P2 labels.
To replace a measurement, press `V` and pick again. To clear it without starting
another, press `V`, then `Esc`. `Esc` alone leaves the existing points in place.

| Readout | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `G1/G2 current (polar)` | Actual displacement in the grain's orthonormal cubic frame, following its rigid rotation; includes strain-induced length and direction changes |
| `G1/G2 lattice [uvw]` | When strain is present, coefficients in the grain's deformed conventional lattice basis; these may stay unchanged for the same atom pair within a grain |
| `Current \|Δr\|/a₀` | Current three-dimensional vector length |
| `View Δxy/a₀` | For cross-grain measurements, components in the displayed projection |

The `current` components and physical lengths are normalized by the reference
a₀; `lattice [uvw]` entries are dimensionless coefficients in the deformed
conventional lattice basis. `[uvw]` denotes a direct-lattice direction, not
reciprocal-plane indices `(hkl)`. Simple components retain forms such as
`a₀/2[1 1 2]`; general directions use real-valued `≈ a₀[...]` components.

The displacement includes deformation, rotation, relative translation and
axial layer-height differences. `P2 axial periodic image` appears in
`GB / VECTOR` while vector picking is active or points are selected. It chooses
P2's axial periodic image from −4 to +4 (default 0), changing the represented
3D vector without adding thickness or replicating the plotted lattice. The
arrow shows only its 2D projection. Panning and display rotation preserve the
grain-frame readouts; displayed cross-grain x/y components follow rotation.

<a id="gui-near-csl"></a>

## Using Near-CSL

Open `NEAR-CSL`, choose `Method`, then click `Enable Near-CSL`. It is off
initially; the active button reads `Disable Near-CSL`.

| Method | What it does | Defaults |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Local matching · no bulk strain` | Pairs same-layer, mutually nearest atoms within a distance threshold; preserves atom positions | Distance 0.1 a₀ |
| `Homogeneous strain + periodic cell` | Searches for a common translation cell under uniform in-plane strain without adding rigid rotation | Principal-strain limit 2%; integer search extent ±12 |

### Local matching without moving atoms

1. Choose `Local matching · no bulk strain` and enable Near-CSL.
2. Set `Local pair distance` (default 0.1 a₀; range 0.0001–0.5 a₀). Results refresh automatically
   when it changes; there is no separate Run button.
3. Enable the desired layer in both grains. Purple midpoint markers identify
   near pairs; dotted links connect their actual atoms. Read the result box
   below the controls and zoom in if links are too short to distinguish.
4. Use purple sites, optionally mixed with gold exact sites in the same layer,
   for the manual-cell workflow below. You can adjust `Local pair distance`
   while picking: existing vertices stay selected as the candidate markers refresh.
   Increase it to expose a later corner, then continue picking after the update.

The threshold is a distance in a₀, not a strain percentage. Pairing is a
same-layer operation, not a cross-layer 3D neighbor search. It leaves atoms in
place and does not establish a periodic cell. Gold exact sites are shown
separately from purple near pairs.

### Automatic homogeneous-strain search

1. Select `Homogeneous strain + periodic cell`. Enable Near-CSL if it is off;
   switching methods while enabled starts the selected method automatically.
2. Set `Max principal strain` (default 2%; range 0.01–10%) and
   `Search index bound` (default 12, meaning ±12; range 2–40). Changes restart
   the search automatically. The result box reports progress while you navigate.
3. The first returned candidate is applied automatically. Choose another entry
   from the candidate dropdown to apply it immediately. Entries report G1/G2
   atom counts and maximum strain. Counts cover all layers in a full axial
   repeat; they are not the single-layer manual count or a Σ value.
4. In `LAYERS`, enable `Automatic common cell` and click `Fit cell`. Read
   strain tensors and common-cell vectors in the `NEAR-CSL` result box; select
   and copy its text if needed.
5. Click `Disable Near-CSL` to return to the original unstrained grains.

Changing a candidate changes the entire grains and clears previous GB, vector
and manual-cell selections. If no candidate is found, unstrained grains remain
displayed; increase the bound or allowed strain if appropriate. This finite
search need not find the globally smallest cell. Its strain is a prescribed
geometric change, not an atomic relaxation or elastic-energy minimum.

<a id="gui-manual-cell"></a>

## Selecting and counting a manual common cell

1. In `LAYERS`, isolate the same layer in both grains. Use a CSL preset for
   gold sites, or enable local matching for purple sites. Expand
   `MANUAL COMMON CELL` and click `Pick 4 CSL vertices` (`M`).
2. Pick four vertices in clockwise or counterclockwise perimeter order. Only
   gold exact CSL sites and purple local near-pair midpoints are eligible;
   ordinary atoms are not. The first vertex fixes the layer. Actual vertices
   of each grain must form a convex, non-degenerate quadrilateral without
   crossed edges.
3. The fourth vertex closes the cell. Outlines in the selected grain colors
   connect the actual G1/G2 atoms. Counts appear at the lower right of the plot and in the panel.
4. `Undo vertex` removes the last point and resumes picking; `Clear` removes
   the manual cell and its counts; `Fit` frames a completed cell. `Esc` pauses
   picking without discarding points. Press `M` to resume an incomplete cell;
   pressing it after four vertices starts a new cell.

For exact CSL sites or local near pairs in the original lattices, you can also
complete a cell from fewer picks. Exact CSL completion needs no Near-CSL mode:

- After two vertices, click `Complete by symmetry…` to preview candidates from
  the paired edge. Choose a candidate to see the two grain outlines, atoms per
  selected layer, original areas and pair distances, required principal strain,
  and polar rotations. All vertices use circles; labels with `(auto)` mark automatically completed vertices.
- After three vertices in perimeter order, click `Complete parallelogram…` to
  generate the fourth vertex separately in each grain.
- `Use candidate` completes the selection without applying strain. Candidates
  must pass the `Selected-cell strain limit` and `Rotation limit / grain` checks;
  these controls become available after the second pick. If a fit exceeds a
  limit, close the preview and adjust the limits or the selection. Cancel keeps
  the original picks and picking mode. Exact CSL cells already coincide and
  need no strain; near cells can be aligned afterward with the existing button.

Generated vertices are actual same-layer lattice sites and can exceed the
`Local pair distance` cutoff. Their labels record `symmetry` or `closure` when
the pair is not exactly coincident. They support counting, Undo, strain/restore
and session saving. Symmetry completion does not guarantee a primitive or
globally smallest cell; if it finds no independent second direction, pick a
third vertex and use parallelogram completion. All four vertices may still be
picked manually.

Overlapping markers from different layers are rejected: isolate one layer and
try again. Wrong-layer, repeated or invalid fourth vertices are also rejected
without removing accepted points. Read the message in the manual-cell panel
and use `Undo vertex` to correct their order.

### Reading the counts

Only the vertex layer is counted, including all its atoms, not just CSL sites.
G1/G2 counts remain separate; overlapping atoms are not merged. For local-pair
vertices, each grain uses its own actual atoms as its boundary. Purple
midpoints are selection aids. The two polygons can have different areas.

| Count | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Interior | Atoms strictly inside the polygon |
| Boundary | Atoms on edges or corners |
| Closed | Interior plus boundary |
| Half-open | For a parallelogram, includes two adjacent lower edges and excludes the opposite upper edges, avoiding double-counting when tiling |

The half-open region is `C1 + u(C2−C1) + v(C4−C1)` with `0 ≤ u,v < 1`.
Non-parallelograms report interior, boundary and closed counts only. A plot
label such as `40 atoms · 34 inside + 5 edge + 1 corner` describes the half-open
count: edge/corner numbers include only retained boundary atoms. `◇ layer`
identifies the layer represented by the diamond marker.

Counts cover the complete polygons, including portions outside the viewport,
and ignore display-layer toggles. Check `Apply GB side visibility to counts`
to additionally restrict them to the selected GB sides. Pan, zoom and display
rotation do not change counts or clear unfinished selections.

A geometric selection, including a parallelogram, does not itself prove
periodicity or establish a primitive CSL cell or Σ. Changing lattice, axis,
reference angle or physical strain invalidates it. Changing the local threshold
preserves selected atom pairs and counts, even when a smaller threshold hides
their near-pair markers. Leaving local matching clears cells containing local pairs.
The apply/restore workflow below preserves its own paired selection.

<a id="gui-selected-strain"></a>

## Applying strain to a selected cell

This option becomes available after selecting four same-layer vertices in
local matching, including at least one near or generated pair. Gold exact vertices
in the same layer may be mixed in. Selecting a cell alone does not deform it;
this is separate from automatic `Homogeneous strain + periodic cell` search.

1. Once all four vertices are selected, set `Selected-cell strain limit`
   (default 2%; range 0.01–10%) and `Rotation limit / grain` (default 1°;
   range 0–5°). The limits are independent; use 0° for pure symmetric strain.
2. Click `Apply bulk strain to selected cell`. Both entire grains receive
   uniform transformations and translations to align the paired vertices.
   An incompatible fourth corner, degenerate fit or exceeded limit leaves
   the original state unchanged and displays a reason near the button.
3. On success, the button becomes `Restore original local structure` and
   the method label becomes `Local cell · bulk strain applied`. Inspect the
   updated atoms, exact CSL sites and selected-layer counts. The common cell
   starts at aligned C1 and need not be primitive.
4. Scroll within the newly displayed details box. Select its text and use
   the usual copy shortcut to retain it. Details include signed principal
   strains, stretches, rigid rotations, `F/R/U` tensors, Green–Lagrange strain
   `E`, translations, area changes, residuals and common-cell vectors.
   Percentages and dimensionless tensors are labeled separately; cell vectors
   use the unrotated analysis coordinates.
5. Click `Restore original local structure` to recover the atoms and original
   paired vertices. Picking, `Undo vertex`, `Clear`, the local threshold and
   limit fields are unavailable while the fit is applied. Restore before
   editing them and applying a different fit.

`ORIENTATION` retains the reference misorientation (`Reference θ`). The details
also show current polar-frame misorientation: the reference plus G1's rigid
rotation minus G2's. Display rotation is independent of these quantities.
Pan, zoom, display rotation and worker changes preserve an applied fit.
Apply/restore clears old GB and vector selections; changing lattice, axis,
reference angle or method clears the applied state.

The fit favors small changes from the original grains and checks the limits;
it does not search all possible admissible fits. It is an imposed geometric
transformation, not a stress-free configuration or an energy relaxation.

## Saving the current plot

1. Finish choosing the angle, layers, view and annotations, then wait for
   pending calculations and counts. Use display rotation and the appropriate
   `Fit` action to arrange the image.
2. Scroll to the bottom of `Controls`. Leave `Clean PNG (atoms only)` unchecked
   for the annotated plot, or check it for just the visible G1/G2 atom symbols.
   Then click `Export PNG…`.
3. Choose a folder and a `.png` filename, then save. Normal export opens
   `Export dichromatic pattern` with the default name `dichromatic_pattern.png`;
   clean export opens `Export atoms only` with `dichromatic_atoms.png`.
   Cancel closes the dialog without saving.

The PNG is 1800 pixels wide. Normal export contains the plot, title, axes, legend
and currently displayed annotations, including display rotation and enabled grain
reference axes. Controls and their detailed result boxes are outside the exported
plot; copy their text separately when needed.

`Clean PNG (atoms only)` is off by default. When enabled, the image preserves the
current view, display rotation, grain/layer and GB-side filtering, atom colors,
symbols and sizes, and the plot background. It omits floating legends, reference
axes and readouts, the title, coordinate axes, grid and border, CSL highlights,
local-pair markers and links, cell outlines, GB lines and vector annotations.
Exporting leaves the live view, selections and numerical state unchanged. This
checkbox only affects PNG export and is not stored in `.dmap` sessions.
PNG is an image export, not a saved interactive session.

<a id="gui-session"></a>

## Saving a session and numerical tables

1. Finish the desired selections and strain application. Wait for active calculations
   if you want to save their completed results.
2. At the bottom of `Controls`, click `Save session…`, beside `Export PNG…`.
3. In the file dialog, choose a folder and filename ending in `.dmap`, then save.
   This writes one file; cancelling leaves the current session unchanged.
4. To continue later, open `ORIENTATION` and click `Import session…`. Choose the
   `.dmap` file. It replaces the current window's session, so save any current work
   you want to retain first. Invalid or unsupported files leave the current session intact.

The session retains the lattice, integer tilt axis, full-precision reference angle,
lattice constant, GB endpoints, vector endpoints and axial periodic image, manual
cell vertices, each grain's deformation gradient and translation, applied common
cell, and the original vertices needed by `Restore original local structure`.
It also retains grain/layer and GB-side visibility, selected-cell counting options,
Near-CSL and strain limits, display rotation, reference-axis visibility, grain
colors, layer symbols, per-layer sizes and the view. Older session files use
100% sizes when no sizes were saved, and default colors and symbols when those
settings were not saved.
Explicitly saved local-pair distances are restored unchanged; the 0.1 a₀ default
applies to new sessions.
If the window has a different aspect ratio, the restored view keeps its center
and expands as needed to include the saved region without distorting the lattice.
Partial selections are retained so picking can continue. Worker count stays at the
current computer's setting; atom buffers and counts are rebuilt after import.
Only the applied strain candidate is retained, not the entire previous search list.
An enabled strain search with no applied cell remains unstrained after import;
change its search settings to start a new search.

A `.dmap` file is a standard ZIP archive. Use a ZIP tool to open it (or copy it and
change the copy's extension to `.zip`). Its contents are:

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `session.json` | Versioned state used by `Import session…` |
| `counts.csv` | Each grain's selected-layer manual-cell counts: interior, boundary, closed and available half-open counts, area, and GB-filter status |
| `vectors.csv` | P1→P2 in analysis/display coordinates and applicable grain polar/lattice frames, with axial-image and length information |
| `strain.csv` | Per-grain deformation, polar rotation/stretch, Green–Lagrange strain, principal strains, translations and reference/current angles |
| `README.txt` | Table units, coordinate conventions and missing-result rules |

Open the CSV files in a spreadsheet or read them with Python's `csv` module.
Lengths are labeled in a₀ or Å, areas in a₀² or Å², and strain tensors are dimensionless.
The vector table distinguishes current spatial components from lattice `[uvw]`
coordinates. Counts are recomputed for the complete selected region, respecting
its optional GB-side filter, independently of the viewport. With fewer than four
cell vertices, `counts.csv` contains only its header; with fewer than two vector
endpoints, `vectors.csv` does the same. Unstrained grains have identity deformation
and zero strain, not a missing result. Editing a CSV does not change restored state.

PNG remains a separate figure export. The `.dmap` file contains numerical state
and tables; export a PNG as well when you need the rendered image.

## Using the Python library

The following example uses only the numerical library and NumPy. It generates
two FCC [110] grains with a 22° reference misorientation, finds exact and local
matches, and counts layer 0 inside a square.

```python
import numpy as np
from dichromatic_map import (
    get_geometry,
    projected_columns,
    same_layer_coincidence_sites,
    local_near_pairs,
    count_cell_atoms,
)

angle = 22.0
geometry = get_geometry("FCC", "110")
grain1 = projected_columns(12, 9, angle / 2, lattice="FCC", axis="110")
grain2 = projected_columns(12, 9, -angle / 2, lattice="FCC", axis="110")

sites = same_layer_coincidence_sites(grain1, grain2, tolerance=1e-6)
pairs = local_near_pairs(grain1, grain2, distance=0.1)
print("Exact sites per layer:", [len(layer_sites) for layer_sites in sites])
print("Local near pairs:", len(pairs.layers))

vertices = np.array([[-2, -2], [2, -2], [2, 2], [-2, 2]], dtype=float)
counts = count_cell_atoms(
    vertices,
    angle,
    deformations=(np.eye(2), np.eye(2)),
    lattice="FCC",
    axis="110",
    layer=0,
)
print("Axial layers:", geometry.layer_count)
print("G1/G2 layer-0 closed counts:", (counts.interior + counts.boundary)[:, 0])
print("G1/G2 layer-0 half-open counts:", counts.half_open[:, 0])
```

The square is a counting region, not a claim of crystal periodicity. Matching
uses the supplied projected columns; counting covers the complete polygon
independently of the generated viewing rectangle.

For a simple-cubic example, an unrotated [100] square of side 2 a₀ contains
four atoms per grain under the half-open convention, or nine when all boundary
atoms are included:

```python
import numpy as np
from dichromatic_map import get_geometry, count_cell_atoms

geometry = get_geometry("SC", "100")
vertices = np.array([[0, 0], [2, 0], [2, 2], [0, 2]], dtype=float)
counts = count_cell_atoms(
    vertices, 0, (np.eye(2), np.eye(2)), lattice="SC", axis="100", layer=0
)
print(geometry.layer_count)                         # 1
print(counts.half_open[:, 0])                       # [4 4]
print((counts.interior + counts.boundary)[:, 0])     # [9 9]
```

### API reference

These six functions are available directly from `dichromatic_map`:

| Function | Inputs and results |
| --- | --- |
| `get_geometry(lattice="FCC", axis="110")` | Returns the planar basis, axial period, layer count and related crystal geometry |
| `misorientation_range(axis="110", lattice="FCC")` | Returns an immutable `AngleRange` with `maximum_deg`, `period_deg` and `symmetry_order`; for [110], these are 90°, 180° and 2 |
| `projected_columns(width, height, rotation_deg, ...)` | Returns `positions` (N×2, in a₀), zero-based `layers` and reference `half_indices` (N×3, in a₀/2); accepts a view center, a 2×2 deformation and a uniform translation |
| `same_layer_coincidence_sites(grain_1, grain_2, tolerance)` | Returns one N×2 array of coincidence positions per layer; tolerance is in a₀ |
| `local_near_pairs(grain1, grain2, distance=0.1, ...)` | Returns actual endpoints `first`/`second`, layer labels, `midpoints` and `distances`; excludes exact pairs from the local overlay |
| `exact_csl_cell(angle, max_denominator=128, lattice="FCC", axis="110")` | Returns a layer-preserving common translation cell for recognized commensurate angles, otherwise `None`; `max_denominator` bounds both primitive quaternion coefficients `m` and `n`; the cell is primitive within the layer-preserving plane, not necessarily in 3D |
| `count_cell_atoms(vertices, angle, deformations, ...)` | Accepts a shared 4×2 polygon or two 2×4×2 per-grain polygons, two 2×2 deformations, optional translations and a layer index; returns per-grain/per-layer counts and per-grain areas |

The reference misorientation `angle` is in degrees, with G1/G2 rotated by
`+angle/2` and `−angle/2`. The numerical geometry and rotation functions use
the supplied angle without imposing the viewer’s reduced input range.
Projected-column deformations act after the grain
rotation; translations act after deformation. `exact_csl_cell(...).cell`
contains the two common cell vectors as columns, in a₀.

`count_cell_atoms` defaults to `layer=-1`, counting all axial layers over one
axial repeat. Specify a zero-based layer for the same counting scope as a GUI
manual cell. Count results have shape `(2, layer_count)`; unselected layers
contain zeros. Inspect `half_open_available` for each grain before using its
half-open count. `areas` contains each grain's polygon area in a₀².

For selected-cell fitting, import
`strain_selected_cell` from `dichromatic_map.strain`. Supply `vertices` with
shape `(2, 4, 2)` containing actual paired atom positions, the reference angle,
and the selected layer. Optional `percent` and `max_rotation_deg` set the
strain and rotation limits. The returned result contains the common cell,
per-grain transformations, translations, aligned vertices and fit residual.
See [implementation details](development.md) for the algorithm and tensor
conventions.

## Limits and troubleshooting

| Symptom | What to check |
| --- | --- |
| A control is missing | Scroll the panel, open the relevant section or switch tabs. GB-side controls appear after B1/B2; the P2 axial option appears during/after vector picking. |
| No atoms are visible | In `LAYERS`, choose `All layers`; press `F` to restore GB sides and `C` to return to the origin. Wait for any calculation to finish. |
| No gold/purple markers | Enable the same layer in both grains and check GB sides. For gold sites, try a CSL preset; for purple sites, enable local matching and check its distance. |
| `Fit cell` is unavailable, or no automatic outline appears | A compatible periodic cell must exist. Choose a CSL preset or a successful automatic strain candidate, then check `Automatic common cell`. |
| A click selects the wrong grain | Check the P1/P2 label. Hide the unwanted grain/layer before picking; exactly overlapping G1/G2 atoms favor G1. |
| A manual vertex is rejected | Use gold/purple sites in one layer, isolate overlapping layers, and choose distinct vertices around the perimeter. Read the panel message; use `Undo vertex` if the ordering needs correction. |
| Selected-cell strain controls are disabled | Enable local matching and finish four same-layer vertices with at least one near pair. If a fit is already active, restore it before editing. |
| No automatic strain candidate | Read the result box, then increase `Search index bound` or the strain limit if suitable. A finite search can return no compatible cell. |
| Selected-cell strain fails | Read the reason beside the button. Correct incompatible corners or revise the strain/rotation limits; the failed fit leaves the structure unchanged. |
| Counts differ from visible points | Manual counts cover the whole selected polygon in one layer; check half-open versus closed counts and `Apply GB side visibility to counts`. |
| A PNG lacks strain tables | Export contains the plot; copy text from the result boxes separately. |


Reduced axis indices must have absolute value at most 64. A geometry may have
up to 256 axial layers, and a requested region may enumerate up to 250,000
candidate columns per grain. A selection that exceeds the limit reports an
error instead of returning a partial count.

- **Viewer dependencies are missing:** run `python -m pip install ".[gui]"`
  from the downloaded project's root directory.
- **Cannot import `dichromatic_map`:** install from the project root with
  `python -m pip install .` for numerical use, or `python -m pip install ".[gui]"`
  for the viewer.
- **No display server:** use the offscreen PNG export command above.
- **Process creation is restricted:** launch with `--workers 1`.
- **View, axis or selection exceeds a limit:** reduce the view or selection
  size, or choose a lower-index axis. Counts from a partial view do not replace
  a complete selected-cell count.
